# Dice_Game

This is a Code_along game taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpmFbWO6HPU&list=PL6fcoQ_2vdNGKP6oog28wUA0zGiG0kgXm 

It is a very simple game, I have personally added some comments so it could be understood but I think it would also be clearer if explained here:

- There is the option to choose the number of the players (2-4) as long as it is not a single palyer
- Every player gets the chance to roll a dice
- If the dice shows 1, then the next player has to play
- If the dice shows 2-6, the player can decide if they want to roll again to accumulate points or stop and add the accumulated points to the total number of the points
- The first player who reaches 50, winsx
